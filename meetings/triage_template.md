# SIG-Testing Issue Triage Template

The standard workflow for clarifying issues in the SIG-Testing backlog.

## Bookkeeping

* Navigate to [Discord text channel #sig-testing](https://discord.gg/XwC9P5ay) and also join the voice channel for SIG-Testing.
* Wait up to three minutes past the hour for attendees to arrive before starting the meeting. During this time open the following browser tabs:
  * [SIG-Testing issues](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Atriage%2Faccepted%2Ctriaged%2Fneeds-information%2Cmtg-agenda)
  * [O3DE Issues for sig/testing](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asig%2Ftesting+-label%3Atriage%2Faccepted%2Ctriage%2Fneeds-information)
  * [O3DE Docs Issues for sig/testing](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asig%2Ftesting+-label%3Atriage%2Faccepted%2Ctriage%2Fneeds-information)

## Triage Process

* [Start a Screen Share in Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share) of your web browser, so attendees can easily follow along
* For each untriaged issue in each repo:
  * Read aloud its title and summarize what it proposes.
  * Is this appropriate for SIG-Testing to own?
    * If obviously not, assign another SIG that should own this issue and do no additional triage steps.
  * Is this issue clear? Is it obvious how someone would start work?
    * If not, mark it as needs-information, assign it to the requester, and request clarification in a comment.
  * Remove the needs-triage label and add triage/accepted.
* If there is time, attempt to clarify issues marked as needs-information by removing that label from the filter.

## Closing

* Clarify any unexpected action items (other than marking issues as needs-information)
* Thank everyone who attended!
