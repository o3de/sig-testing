# SIG-Testing Meetings Template

The standard meeting agenda for SIG-Testing discussions.

## Bookkeeping

* Navigate to [Discord text channel #sig-testing](https://discord.gg/XwC9P5ay) and also join the voice channel for SIG-Testing.
* Wait up to three minutes past the hour for attendees to arrive before starting the meeting. During this time:
  * Look for the [SIG-Testing meeting agenda issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amtg-agenda) if one was already established.
  * Establish who will take meeting notes, with an action item for them to commit notes into GitHub in the [SIG-Testing meeting notes](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/tree/main/meetings/notes) section.

## Outline Meeting Agenda

* Briefly mention the major sections of the agenda, and whether any appear urgent.
  * Mention any notable changes in agenda.

## Standard Agenda

### Urgent Updates

* SIG Governance changes from Technical Sterring Committee
* Policy changes from SIG-Testing RFCs
* Critical issues or outages

### Agenda Discussion Topics

* Cover topics on the existing SIG-Testing meeting agenda.
  * If discussion of any topic exceeds five minutes, propose a separate meeting or RFC to clarify it further.

### Open Roundtable Discussion

* If there is an RFC ready for today leave time afterward to discuss it, or postpone the roundtable
* State how the roundtable will operate, and then follow its steps:
  * Invite all attendees to suggest additional topics, collecting multiple topics before starting discussion for as long as five minutes.
  * For each topic, restate the prompt and ask the group for opinions (or ask topic requester to clarify)
    * Discuss each for around five minutes, or until discussion stops for one full minute
    * Ask the topic requester to summarize their takeaways

### RFC Reading and Discussion

* [Link the RFC issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Arfc-feature%2Crfc-suggestion+) into Discord channel
* This process will take at least 20 minutes, with 10 for reading and 10 for feedback.
  * If there is insufficient time, propose an additional meeting time.
  * Ask attendees to spend ten minutes reading the proposal, adding text comments if they prefer to.
  * Ask attendees to stop reading and discuss the proposal verbally.
  * Clarify next steps for the RFC.

## Closing

* Clarify action items and their owners, including notetaker.
* Thank everyone who attended!
