# SIG-Testing meeting notes from 2021-12-03 @ 1830 UTC

* Moderator: amzn-dk
* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG-Testing Chair Nominations

Kadino, dialweb06, and amzn-dk have been helping steer SIG, but there is an official nomination process. Please view this in the SIG issues on GitHub.

There are qualifications to be nominated, though there are also exceptions to this. Documentation contributions count for these requirements.

## SIG Testing Meetings

SIG Testing triage meeting should occur at the same time in one week. Have done some independent triage to make sure this isn't overflowing.

Additional work needs to be done on priority and clarification, as well as routing certain tasks to other SIGs.

Will send a calendar invite through the sig-testing mailing list.

## General Discussion

* How do you get on the sig-testing mailing list?
  * [lists.o3de.org](https://lists.o3de.org) has a subgroup for testing
