# SIG-Testing meeting notes from 2023-01-10 @ 1900 UTC

* Moderator: Kadino
* Note Taker: Kadino

## SIG Updates

* There is a new issue status and template for [kind/roadmap](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing/pull/59), which SIG-Release wants us to use to communicate roadmap items.
  * Essentially for appropriate for what Agile calls an Epic.
* 2023 meeting time change was brought up in previous SIG-Testing meeting.

## Roundtable Discussion

### What 2023 planning work is appropriate?

* GitHub issue backlog is primary source of truth
* Reach out to TSC / Release for planning feedback
* Investigate reducing need to meet synchronously?
  * Discord chat, threads
  * GitHub Issues, Pull Requests
  * Avoid new tools + processes, already too much complexity
* Document "where do I go to find XYZ" which has fairly bad UX in O3DE
* Meeting redundancy will be frustrating, so focus on a better time

## RFCs

### Current RFCs are all pending work

## Action Items

* Kadino: Create SIG-Testing meeting time poll, spread awareness
* Kadino: Give feedback to SIG-Docs about contributor communication complexity
* Kadino: Mark kind/roadmap on existing issues such as RFCs
