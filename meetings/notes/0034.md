  * Just over half of poll-takers were available at this time.

## Roundtable Discussion

### Testing docs

* Noticed there was feedback on best practices doc
  * Feedback was from sharing with other public and open source testing communities
  * sig-docs-community has been a moderate bottleneck for delivering public docs
    * Large workload of docs from all SIGs
    * We should keep any deliveries here to core concepts with low-frequency changes
* GitHub wiki doesn't have the same formal review process a public docs
  * can be directly edited by contributors
  * more streamlined to create, but difficult to find
  * .md files in a (SIG) repo are similarly useful, can link to wiki pages, plus are easy to do PRs with
    * GH Wiki sidebar-file has a similar function, but can become busy very fast

## RFCs

### Current RFCs are all pending work before review

## Action Items

* Kadino: Find a project admin to get the board accessible.
* Kadino: Update O3DE calendar for meeting time change.
